			<h3>Stan's Life</h3>

			<p>
				Stanley Martin Lieber was born on December 28, 1922, in New York City to
				Romanian immigrants Celia and Jack Lieber. With part of his childhood
				spent during the Great Depression, Lieber and his younger brother,
				Larry, watched his parents struggle to make ends meet for the family.
				Lieber, who later shortened his name to "Lee" as a writer, went on to be
				hired as an office assistant at Timely Comics in 1939 and became an
				interim editor for the company in the early 1940s. Lee also served
				domestically in the Army during World War II, working as a writer and
				illustrator. In the early '60s, Lee was called upon by his boss to
				create a series for Marvel Comics (Timely's new name) that could compete
				with rival DC Comics' hit title Justice League of America. Citing
				writing influences like Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Jules Verne, and
				following the encouragement of his wife, Joan, Lee did away with some of
				the usual superhero conventions. Hence, with artist and co-creator Jack
				Kirby, the Fantastic Four was born in 1961. Following the success of the
				Fantastic Four, a slew of new characters soon sprung from Lee and his
				Marvel cohorts, including the Hulk, Spider-Man, Doctor Strange,
				Daredevil and the X-Men. Lee was particularly known for his dynamism
				with copy and for imbuing his characters with a sense of humanity,
				tackling real-world issues like bigotry and drug use, which would
				influence comics for decades. An outgoing, humorous showman, he also
				developed a number of slogans as part of his shtick, including a
				Latin-derived call to rise, "Excelsior!" Marvel Comics became a highly
				popular franchise, and Stan Lee was promoted to editorial director and
				publisher in 1972. He later moved to the West Coast to be involved in
				Marvel's film ventures and eventually became chairman emeritus.
